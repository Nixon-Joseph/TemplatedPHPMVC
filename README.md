Awesome MVC framework modeled after .NET's razor.

Uses [Liquid](https://github.com/kalimatas/php-liquid) for front end template parsing, and dapper-like db access repositories.

For quick startup template, or test project, see [the Demo](https://github.com/Nixon-Joseph/TemplatedPHPMVC_Demo).

Available in packagist via composer: `composer require devpirates/templated-php-mvc`

We highly recommend [these email templates](https://github.com/wildbit/postmark-templates) for your system's emails.
